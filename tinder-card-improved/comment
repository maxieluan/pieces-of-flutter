plans:

1. like Tinder: 
    a. initialize a stack of card
    b. each swipe move a card out of screen, not putting back, destroyed maybe
    c. move the underlying card front.
    d. until the stack runs out, go back to step 1

2. needs to use animation on swiping. 
    a. branch out at certain threshold
        i. if keeps moving, animate card out of screen.
        ii. if moving stopes before threshold, animate card back to the stack.
    b. while at it, also move the back cards up at the same time.
